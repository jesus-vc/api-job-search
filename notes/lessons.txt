My lessons from building this project:

Syntax:
 - 

- Make smaller commits to reduce the complexity of refactoring.

 - As I conducted test-driven development, I naturally built routes that passed various tests. However I've seen many opportunities to simplify and consolidate my code (e.g. consolidating my helper functions). However, I chose not to refactor until I finish achieving all the functionality required.

 - And actually as I type this, I realize that I should commit earlier so that I'm refactoring smaller chunks of code.

- Variable names and comments: Focus on describing the action.
